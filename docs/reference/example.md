description: Useful references for Aurora outside of the official documentation.

If you can't find something that you're looking for, maybe our sister project docs or the official Fedora Kinoite documentation covers your point of interest. You can find them here:

- [**Bluefin Documentation**](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/): Relevant information for Aurora outside of the GNOME specific tweaks.
- [**Bazzite Documentation**](https://docs.bazzite.gg): Some information will not apply to Aurora, but most of it may be useful to reference for topics you are unsure about.
- [**Fedora Kinoite Documentation**](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-kinoite/): Aurora would not exist without Fedora Kinoite, so it's best to reference technical information here.
