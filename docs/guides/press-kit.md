Thank you for engaging and generating content about Aurora and Universal-Blue, it means a lot!

We want to explain how to use the brand and terminology we use in this project.

## Terminology

We call our project `Aurora`, there is no long or short-hand version of that name. :D 

Aurora is built with and on [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org), which publishes base images that Aurora uses. These in turn are derived from Fedora's Kinoite images. Universal Blue is the parent organization of [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io), [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev), and [uCore](https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore). It also acts as the GitHub organization.

## Proper Usage of name

- Aurora: used to refer to this project and the operating system
- Aurora DX: used to refer to the developer experience edition of Aurora
- Aurora Helium LTS: this is used to refer to the Long Term Support Release of Aurora.


## Improper usage of name

- AuroraOS - or any addition of "OS" to the name
- Fedora Aurora - we are not directly related to Fedora and this name implies that. Checkout the [Mission Document](https://universal-blue.org/mission.html) from Universal Blue.
- Universal Blue Aurora or uBlue Aurora - "Bluefin is built with Universal Blue" or "Bluefin is a Universal Blue image" is recommended instead.
- "Immutable Distribution" - Aurora is an operating system, it is neither immutable nor a distribution, it is a custom image based on Fedora or CentOS, depending on the edition.
