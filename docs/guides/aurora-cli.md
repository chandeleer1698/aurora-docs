Aurora CLI is a opt-in containerized command line experience with many modern terminal tools included. It can be turned on and off, depending on your usecase and preferred command line experience.

It comes with these fantastic command line tools:

- [atuin](https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin) for shell history
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/) to load and unload environment variables depending on the current directory.
- [eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) as a replacement `ls`
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) for `find`
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for command line fuzzy finding
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) for search
- [tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer) for `tldr`
- [television](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/television) - a blazing fast general-purpose fuzzy finder TUI - (`tv`)
- [trash-cli](https://github.com/andreafrancia/trash-cli) to manage the system trashcan. (Strongly recommended for new CLI users)
- [ugrep](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep) for grep
- [uutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils) as coreutils
- [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) for yaml, json, and xml processing
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) as `cd`

To enable this command line experience, run `ujust aurora-cli`. We will add more utilities and tweak this experience over time.
