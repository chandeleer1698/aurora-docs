description: System requirements to comofortably use Aurora
---

Using Aurora on your computer does not require any special sauce, but there are some system requirements you should be aware of. Other than the hard requirement of a 64-bit capable CPU (AMD/Intel) you should have at least the following system specifications on your Aurora Box:

- A recent quad-core (or 4 threads) or higher multicore processor with at least 2 GHz clock speed
- 4GB of RAM
- A modern GPU
  - For **Nvidia** Users: A GTX 900 Series GPU or newer is required. There are no images for older Nvidia GPU hardware. If you have an older Nvidia GPU, then you can try the non-Nvidia editions to utilize the open source nouveau support.
- SSD with at least 40GB of free space to have space for now and future updates
  - A spinning hard disk drive will run Aurora, but updates and other I/O heavy operations will decrease performance greatly.
