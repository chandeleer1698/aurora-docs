This documentation is a work-in-progress.  Read the [Bluefin documentation](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/bluefin-dx) since most of the information will also apply to Aurora.

**TODO**:

- 5-Minute Web Developer Setup with Aurora
- Aurora CLI
- Spicing up your terminal with eza and other tools
- Running a local cluster with Kubernetes and Kind
