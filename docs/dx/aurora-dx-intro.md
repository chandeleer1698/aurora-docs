description: About the Aurora Developer Experience
---

Aurora Developer Experience `(aurora-dx)` is a dedicated experience on top of Aurora that features development tools and integrations for developers. Unlike traditional Linux distributions, we heavily embrace containerization and do not install your development tools directly on the host.

Development tools should be scoped to
- your home directory (Homebrew)
- a container (Distrobox, Devcontainers)

This makes managing dependencies easier and poses less risk to break your developer machine. We do not dictate on how you develop, but we take away the footguns that will break your developer machine and ultimately your workflow. Aurora-DX consists of many parts that make a great developer experience together: 
- Integration of QEMU and KVM for an easy virtualization experience
- Preinstalled tools and configurations so you can get started quickly, like Visual Studio Code and Devcontainer Integration
- Easy ways to install your favorite tools like Jetbrains Toolbox
